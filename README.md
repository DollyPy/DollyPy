**Senior Data Science Associate | Machine Learning Engineer**

I'm a passionate and curious technologist with hands-on experience building solutions across **data science**, **machine learning**, and interestingly **Web Development**. I enjoy building things that are impactful, efficient, and scalable—whether it's a full-stack web app, a predictive ML model, or a data-driven dashboard.
